#### Sandbox

The Sandbox is where things get messy. This is where prototype/incomplete code will be stored with little thought to sensible file/directory structure.

Once the external behavior of each of the components has been implemented correctly and is ready for refactoring, the code will be moved out of the Sandbox and into the approriate location in the repository.
